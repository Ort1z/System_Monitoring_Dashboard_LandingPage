## What is a Landing Page?

A Portfolio Project landing page is a webpage that presents information about the project without requiring visitor signup, login, or application usage. It may serve as the main webpage for the project.

### Characteristics of a Great Landing Page

- Informative without requiring user interaction
- Presents key project information succinctly
- May include header/footer links, but focuses on project presentation

### Examples

Good Landing Pages:
- [Slack](https://slack.com/)
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)
- [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/)

Non-Landing Pages:
- Amazon
